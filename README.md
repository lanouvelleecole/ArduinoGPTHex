This is the last baby in the Maslow ecosystem.

This Android app allows us to upload hex programs to a Arduino device, via a USB OTG bridge between your Arduino and your Android phone/tablet.

This app is meant to be used in conjunction with MaslowGPT or ArduinoGPT. Or with a Deep Link URL intent looking like 

`maslow://arduinogpt.com?hex_str=YOUR_ARDUINO_HEX_STRING_HERE`
